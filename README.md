# Data Structures and Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains Java implementations of complex data structures and algorithms. The data structures are then used to build a short application or functionality that uses the data structure to perform a specific task. Each of the files are documented for more information on implementation and functionality. Each of the algorithms is also thoroughly tested via JUnit testing.
